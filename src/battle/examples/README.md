# Battle Library

## Modules

## Examples
This directory contains scripts for running a sample battle.
In order to run a script, type `make examples` followed by `cd examples`. Then run one of the following:

`./battle_command_example.c`
`./battle_flow_example.c`

These are the current scripts: 
* `battle_command_example.c`: Simulates the ability for player input during a battle.
    * Viable commands take the form: X X X X
* `battle_flow_example.c`: Runs a sample battle using hard-coded moves for the player and enemy. This demonstrates how to set up a battle correctly.
