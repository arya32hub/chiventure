// A developor tool for creating and testing custom actions

// This code does not need to be, and should not be peer reviewed. Ideally it will never be
// a part of the final product. The only reason I'm uploading this is there's too many
// issues with other aspects of the project for the sandbox executable 
// (which is supposed to be the deliverable) to even compile, and I need to prove I worked
// on something.
